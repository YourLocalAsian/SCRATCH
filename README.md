# About The Project

The game of billiards, commonly known as pool, is enjoyed by millions of players daily. In many situations, the game of billiards can serve as an icebreaker and a facilitator of social interactions between different people. In other situations, the game is played competitively by professional athletes. Nevertheless, there are many people who cannot reap the social benefits of the game due to a lack of proficiency. Additionally, there has not been any significant effort to include visually impaired individuals in the game by making it accessible to them. While there have been a couple of papers written, information is scarce and the projects were never commercialized. This creates two problems: (1) there exists a proficiency wall that beginners face and find difficult to overcome when trying to play the game of billiards and (2) visually impaired personnel are excluded from the game, regardless of talent or ability. As engineers, it is our job to solve such problems through technology.
